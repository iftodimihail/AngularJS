# Shaping Up With Angular.js Example App

This is a tutorial[Code School](http://codeschool.com/) course on [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) that I've completed.

## Setup

Some features require a server to be running. If you have node and npm
installed, you can run `npm install http-server -g`. Then run the `http-server`
command inside the `app` folder and you should be able to see the application
running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
